# Necronomicon

## Overview
**Necronomicon** is a first-person shooter survival game set in a post-apocalyptic city overrun by zombies.

Designed for a mature audience, Necronomicon blends intense action with strategic gameplay, supported on Windows and Linux platforms. 

**It was made in 2 months for my Game Design Module in University :D**
